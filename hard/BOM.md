##notes: 
   
- (‡) something fancier can be used for the **audio** output ( = the dual op amp being used for audio output).
i've tried **OPA1662, AD8599, and LME49720** in the audio path - not sure whether i'd notice the difference, YMMV. but it's reassuring, sort of.

- (‡‡) the winbond ICs are a bit hard to find, i got mine from alibaba. (there's pin/software compatible alternative ICs at mouser and the usual places, which should work, see [here](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/SerialFlash) for a list of supported devices. alternatively, SPI **SRAM** may be used, ie **23LC1024** (which is pin-compatible and supported by the pjrc audio API, but not part of the eurotrash firmware), cf http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/?info=AudioEffectDelayExternal for details/

- (†) for instance: mouser # 652-PEC11R-4215F-S24 (15 mm, 'D' shaft); 652-PEC11R-4215K-S24 (15 mm shaft, knurled); 652-PEC11R-4220F-S24 (20 mm, 'D'), 652-PEC11R-4220K-S24 (20 mm, knurled), etc. personally/in this case, I prefer 'smooth' encoders, ie without detent: eg 652-PEC11R-4015K-S24)

- (††) while any 4 pin OLED w/ **SH1106** driver and suitable pin-out should work, here's two that's confirmed working: [here](http://www.ebay.de/itm/271817542866) and [here](http://www.ebay.de/itm/331132247980); they can also be had from amazon or aliexpress, cf [here](http://www.amazon.com/Serial-128X64-Display-Module-Arduino/dp/B00JM7SWI4/ref=sr_1_2?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1443270690&sr=1-2&keywords=1.3%22+Serial+128X64+OLED) or [here](http://de.aliexpress.com/item/white-1-3-I2C-IIC-Serial-128X64-12864-OLED-LCD-LED-Display-Module-for-Arduino-51/1669386183.html?isOrigTitle=true) or [here](http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1-3-I2C-IIC-Serial-128X64_1982440011.html?spm=a2700.7724838.30.1.5a3TpQ)
